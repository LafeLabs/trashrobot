<h1>RHIZOME TRASH ROBOT CLASS</h1>

<p>
Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it.  This is our civilization in a nutshell.  The downside of this system is that it 
is doomed--but there is also an upside! Just as a "dead" tree is food for a fungus which metabolizes it back into usable soil to grow
more trees, the products of our wasteful consumer society create a free feedstock for a huge and growing array of useful and
beautiful things.  If we really want to move past dig it up, set it on fire and bury it we need to not just make things
from trash, we need to make the <i>machines</i> to make things from trash, so that the system can self-replicate.  
</p>
<p>
    Also, if we want this system to be at a more human scale and to gain back control over our own technology, we want machines
    that allow us to build things at the scale of a hobby you can do on your kitchen table with simple household tools.  
    The most basic tool you can ask for to this end is a robot that lets you fabricate interesting art from trash by moving 
    some kind of tool around in a programmable way. 
</p> 
<p>
    The method of production here is peer-to-peer crowd sourcing: you supply what you can find, want to build, 
    or can afford.  There are no prerequisites for any one participant: we will build a community of people who can 
    share skills and materials, so that if you only want to work with cardboard, or only electronics or only sticks and rope
    you can specialize and share output from others' parts of the process.  We also need people to simply use this stuff, 
    to make art with it and try to develop the skill set of finding more new ways to use it.  Our current industrial model 
    assumes a small number of people will make millions of a thing and distribute it to millions of people who have no role
    in its production.  In Trash Robot we distribute production amongst users in an organic way, replacing "producers" and "consumers"
    with a more rhizomatic structure in which we all participate in both production and use, as well as teaching others to expand the system.
    As we expand this approach to more and more types of industrial production, it should be possible to replace larger and larger
    parts of what is now called the "economy" with more rhizomatic systems which can provide our basic needs without money,
    mining, or the trappings of the existing property system.  Free robots for everyone!
